# Template Instructions

1. Assign work item leads by their github handles in the [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) file.
2. Tag overseeing WG with that WG's tag (i.e. #ccwg)
3. Assign orgs/teams within DIF and define openness to external PRs depending on IPR policy
4. Get to definitioning. A starter document structure can be found in `single-file-test/spec.md`. This guide can be expanded and altered but following the high level structure will make it easier for readers to get up to speed with the profile.
5. Configure GitPages!
